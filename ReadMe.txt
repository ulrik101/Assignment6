PLEASE READ:
Docker had stopped working on the 12/13/2018. By stopped working i mean that it no longer recognized directories where code was stored.
using ls, ls -ls, and ls -R, and many other commands, i tried to find if the directories were moved and for general troubleshooting.
On 12/14/2018 i had to resort to using an online Linux compiler, FOUND HERE: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_terminal_online.php
My code compiled there after i had uploaded a zip file containing everything, unzipping it, then running the g++ as normal.

Because of this, the average times are different on the online linux compiler from those that are on my computer.
